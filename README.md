# CMPM-121-Phaser-Valley
# Devlog Entry - 11/13/2024
## Introducing the Team
### Erik Lu / kami-lel:
### Haorong Rong / hrong1:
### Ian Wallace / 14N-W4774c3:
### Jc Zaragoza / Jzara3115: 

## Tools and Materials
### We intend to use the Phaser3 framework, as we're all familiar with it and it provides some simple options for changing engines partway through the assignment.
### We will start out working in JavaScript.  We all took CMPM 120, so this is nothing new.  This allows us to focus on making the game within the remaining time in the course.
### We expect to be using Tiled for some graphical assets and Visual Studio for coding.  Again, these are things we're all familiar with, so we can focus on swapping over and making the game instead of getting distracted learning new tools.  We may also make use of some open source assets, to minimize the time spent on non-coding tasks.
### We will be swapping to Phaser3 / TypeScript.  Some members of the group expressed a dislike of Javascript, so we decided to swap away from it rather than swapping to it.

## Outlook
### For the most part, we're looking to focus on learning how to handle transitioning from one engine to another, with minimal focus on the added difficulty of learning new tools, frameworks, or languages.  We're not taking any particular additional risks or challenges - those are good ways to miss deadlines, and we're in the holiday season.
